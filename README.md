# Simple Study Case Forecasting

This repository demonstrates a simple public forecasting case I developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

To achieve confident results, I employed two different approaches:
1. **ARIMA** – a statistical method, including its specific analysis, to model and forecast time series data.
2. **N-Beats** – a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, implemented with TensorFlow, for more complex and scalable forecasting.

Both methods were applied to showcase their respective strengths and the versatility of combining statistical techniques with modern deep learning frameworks.
